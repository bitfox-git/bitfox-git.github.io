## We developed the DigiDOPA app for Parkinson patients.

The DigiDOPA-app assists patients and doctors with personal and optimal tuning of their medication. The app registers medication intake and the actual response, to help them determine the quantatity and frequency of the intake, resulting in an improvement in Parkinson's symptoms.
